Subject: Proposal: Streamlining EPL-X Grafana Monitoring Dashboard via Custom Prometheus Exporter

Hi Team,

As we look to enhance the efficiency of our EPL-X workflow monitoring, I'd like to suggest that we consider developing a custom Prometheus exporter. This tool would be specifically designed to gather key metrics from our infrastructure, helping to streamline our data collection processes.

Centralized Data Collection: 

The exporter would centralize the collection of crucial metrics such as build queue length, build duration, success/failure rates, and resource utilization. All these metrics would be exposed through a single endpoint, allowing Grafana to efficiently consume and visualize the data.
Key Benefits:

1. Flexibility: We could adjust metrics in the exporter as needed without altering Grafana panels.
2. Enhanced Visibility: Better dashboard insights would enable us to proactively identify and resolve issues more effectively.

Can we discuss this idea further with Chandra & Observability team? 

Please review this.
