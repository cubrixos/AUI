### Updated Consolidated CI/CD Performance Dashboard Specification

#### **Purpose**
The CI/CD performance dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive, real-time overview and historical analysis of the CI/CD processes using GitHub Actions. It helps teams monitor, analyze, and optimize the build environment, enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making capabilities.

#### **Dashboard Layout and Design**

1. **Bar Charts Integration**:
   - **Current and Historical Metrics**: Utilize bar charts to display current and historical metrics. This includes the number of builds in various states (queued, in progress, successful, failed, cancelled, skipped, timed out).
   - **Daily Metrics Overview**: Show daily counts of builds across different statuses to track daily operational health.
   - **Historical Trends**: Implement bar charts to visualize trends over longer periods (weekly, monthly) to identify patterns or anomalies in the build process.

2. **Real-Time Data Updates**:
   - Ensure that the dashboard updates in real-time, particularly for metrics like builds in queue and in progress, using bar charts to reflect changes instantly.

3. **Status Overview Section**:
   - Include a dedicated section using color-coded bar charts for intuitive and quick recognition of different build statuses:
     - Green bars for successful builds.
     - Red bars for failed builds.
     - Orange bars for timed out builds.
     - Blue bars for builds in progress.
     - Grey bars for cancelled and skipped builds.

4. **Detailed Interactive Views**:
   - Provide interactive elements within each bar chart, allowing users to click on bars for a detailed breakdown of specific data points and logs.

5. **Filtering and Search Capabilities**:
   - Offer robust filtering options to view data by date range, project, or repository, and include search functionality to quickly locate specific builds or statuses.

#### **User Interaction and Accessibility**

- **Interactive Charts**: Bar charts will include tooltips and clickable areas for detailed data access. Hover effects will provide more information about each bar segment.
- **Accessibility Features**: Ensure the design meets accessibility standards, with adequate color contrasts and text descriptions for screen readers.

#### **Technical Considerations**

- **Efficient Data Handling**: Utilize efficient backend APIs to fetch and update data dynamically, ensuring minimal latency and high data accuracy.
- **Security Protocols**: Implement rigorous security measures for data transmission and API interactions.

#### **Business Impact**

- **Operational Insight**: Bar charts will provide clear, quantitative insights into the CI/CD processes, aiding in rapid assessment and response to issues.
- **Strategic Analysis**: Historical data visualized through bar charts will help in strategic planning by revealing trends and outcomes over time.

### Implementation Phases

- **Prototype and User Testing**: Develop initial prototypes featuring bar charts for user feedback. Iterate based on testing outcomes.
- **Final Development**: Build out the full dashboard based on finalized designs and user feedback, ensuring robust performance and security
