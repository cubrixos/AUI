### Troubleshooting Guide Template Instructions

This troubleshooting guide template is designed to help engineers document and resolve common issues encountered in our CI/CD product. By standardizing error codes and providing clear resolution steps, we aim to reduce incident tickets and improve response times.

#### Template Breakdown

**Error Code: [ERR-001]**
- **Purpose**: Assign a unique identifier to each error for easy reference.
- **Example**: ERR-S3-001 for an S3-related issue.

**Title: [Short description of the error]**
- **Purpose**: Provide a brief, descriptive title of the issue.
- **Example**: "Object Store Bucket Full"

**Description**
- **Purpose**: Explain the issue in detail, including context and scenarios where it may occur.
- **Example**: "This error occurs when the S3 bucket used for storing build artifacts exceeds its allocated storage limit. Developers may encounter this issue during the build process."

**Symptoms**
- **Purpose**: List the observable symptoms that indicate the issue.
- **Example**: 
  - "Builds fail with an error message indicating storage limits."
  - "Unable to upload new artifacts to the object store."

**Affected Components**
- **Purpose**: Identify which components or subsystems are impacted.
- **Example**: 
  - "S3 Object Store"
  - "Build Pipeline"

**Possible Causes**
- **Purpose**: List potential reasons why the issue occurs.
- **Example**: 
  - "Bucket storage limit exceeded."
  - "Large number of outdated artifacts occupying space."

**Resolution Steps**
- **Purpose**: Provide a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue.
- **Example**:
  1. "Check the bucket storage usage in the AWS S3 console."
  2. "Increase the bucket storage limit or clean up unnecessary files."
  3. "Verify if the issue is resolved by triggering a new build."

**Logs to Review**
- **Purpose**: Specify which logs should be reviewed for diagnostic information.
- **Example**:
  - "S3 access logs"
  - "Build pipeline logs"

**Escalation**
- **Purpose**: Define when and how to escalate the issue if it cannot be resolved.
- **Example**: "If the issue persists after increasing storage, escalate to the cloud services team."

**Contacts for Further Support**
- **Purpose**: Provide contact information for additional help.
- **Example**:
  - "John Doe, Cloud Services Manager"
  - "Jane Smith, Build Pipeline Engineer"

### Instructions for Engineers

1. **Identify Common Issues**: Review incident tickets and identify common issues developers face.
2. **Assign Error Codes**: Create a unique error code for each issue. Follow a standardized format like `ERR-[Component]-[Number]`.
3. **Fill Out the Template**: Use the provided template to document the issue, symptoms, causes, and resolution steps in detail.
4. **Review Logs**: Specify which logs are useful for diagnosing the issue.
5. **Define Escalation Procedures**: Clearly state when and how to escalate unresolved issues.
6. **Provide Contacts**: List contacts who can offer further assistance.
7. **Distribute the Guide**: Ensure all engineers have access to the troubleshooting guide and understand how to use it.

By following these steps, we can create a comprehensive troubleshooting guide that will help reduce incident tickets and streamline the resolution process.
