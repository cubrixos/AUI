### Updated Specifications for the Consolidated CI/CD Performance Dashboard

#### **Purpose**
The CI/CD Performance Dashboard is designed to deliver a comprehensive view of both real-time and historical data regarding CI/CD processes, utilizing GitHub Actions. It aims to aid teams in monitoring, analyzing, and enhancing the efficiency of their build environments for improved operational decision-making.

#### **Dashboard Layout and Design**

1. **Bar Charts Integration**:
   - **Current and Historical Metrics**: Employ bar charts to illustrate both current and historical build metrics, including status classifications such as queued, in progress, successful, failed, cancelled, skipped, and timed out.
   - **Daily Metrics Overview**: Provide daily build counts by status to monitor the operational health of processes.
   - **Historical Trends**: Use bar charts to track trends on a weekly and monthly basis, helping to pinpoint patterns or irregularities within the build processes.

2. **Real-Time Data Updates**:
   - Ensure the dashboard reflects updates in real-time, with special emphasis on metrics such as builds in queue and ongoing builds, visually captured through dynamic bar charts.

3. **Status Overview Section**:
   - Create a section dedicated to displaying build statuses via color-coded bar charts for quick and intuitive status recognition:
     - Green for successful.
     - Red for failures.
     - Orange for timeouts.
     - Blue for ongoing.
     - Grey for cancelled and skipped.

4. **Detailed Interactive Views**:
   - Incorporate interactivity in each bar chart, enabling users to click on specific bars for a granular view of data and logs.

5. **Filtering and Search Capabilities**:
   - Enhance user experience with advanced filtering options by date, project, or repository and a search feature for swift navigation to particular builds or statuses.

#### **User Interaction and Accessibility**

- **Interactive Charts**: Equip bar charts with interactive tooltips and clickable segments for expanded data insights. Hover effects will reveal additional details per segment.
- **Accessibility Features**: Design with accessibility in mind, ensuring clear color contrast and descriptive text for screen readers.

#### **Technical Considerations**

- **Efficient Data Handling**: Utilize optimized backend APIs for real-time data fetching and updates, ensuring both minimal latency and maximum accuracy.
- **Security Protocols**: Employ stringent security measures in data transmission and during API interactions to protect data integrity.

#### **Business Impact**

- **Operational Insight**: Through detailed bar charts, the dashboard will furnish precise insights into CI/CD processes, facilitating swift identification and resolution of issues.
- **Strategic Analysis**: Longitudinal data presented in bar charts will assist in strategic planning by elucidating patterns and results over time.

### Implementation Phases

- **Prototype and User Testing**: Initiate development with prototypes that integrate bar charts for user feedback and refine based on test results.
- **Final Development**: Construct the complete dashboard based on user-validated designs, emphasizing enhanced performance and stringent security measures.
