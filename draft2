As discussed in our recent meeting with the SMEs and the BreakFix team, we have consolidated all defects raised by users (developers), the BreakFix team, and the Solution Engineering SME team. The attached document contains a detailed list of these defects. During Q1 and April, we reported a total of 19 product defects.

This number is significant for just four months and clearly indicates that the current stability of the product is compromised. It is crucial that we address these defects as soon as possible to ensure improved reliability and performance.

Please make it a priority to escalate these issues during your biweekly Engineering meeting with the EPL product owner and Engineering manager.

Additionally, we need each defect to be associated with a scheduled release date and an updated tag version in each defect JIRA. Customers frequently inquire about when these issues will be resolved. Promptly updating this information is essential for transparent communication and customer satisfaction.



Based on the BreakFix and SMEs team's analysis, we've identified the primary sources of incident tickets related to the EPL product:

65% of tickets are due to product defects.
30% of tickets arise from a lack of knowledge regarding EPL product feature configuration, indicating usability issues.
Less than 5% relate to Jenkins infrastructure issues, specifically memory and cache.

To address the significant 30% of tickets caused by usability problems, we propose the development of a self-service and self-healing AI copilot using large language models (LLMs). This tool would empower users to manage and automatically rectify issues within the EPL platform. The Platform Service team has shown serious interest in exploring this innovative approach.

By addressing the product defects and implementing the AI copilot, we aim to substantially reduce the incidence of tickets.
